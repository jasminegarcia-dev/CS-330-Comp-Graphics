## CS‑330 Computer Graphics – Final Project Reflection - Coffee Mug Tabletop

# How do I approach designing software?

I typically begin by breaking things down into smaller, manageable pieces. I thought about what objects I needed in my scene first (a mug, book, plane, cone, and sphere), then worked through how to build them from the basic meshes available. I tried to keep it simple so I wouldn’t overwhelm myself.

# What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

I learned how to make choices about textures and lighting that actually affect how the scene feels. For example, using a warmer point light completely changed the vibe compared to just leaving everything white. I also learned how important camera controls are in designing something that people can actually explore.

# What design process did you follow for your project work?

My process was very step-by-step. I started with the ground plane, then added one object at a time. After that, I layered in textures and then lighting. Finally, I finished with camera movement. It was very much a “build, test, fix, repeat” kind of workflow.

# How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

Breaking things down into smaller steps is useful for any programming project, not just graphics. I also realized the importance of testing often — it’s easier to find and fix issues right after you add something, instead of waiting until the end when everything is tangled together.

# How do I approach developing programs?

I approach development by trying to get the basic functionality working first, then building out from there. For example, I made sure my shapes appeared in the scene before worrying about textures or lighting.

# What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

One new strategy was learning how to integrate shaders and lighting into my code. Before this class, I had never touched that part of programming. I also learned to rely more on trial and error with visuals — sometimes you don’t know what works until you actually see it rendered.

# How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration was huge. Every milestone gave me the chance to test my scene, add a new feature, and then adjust. By the time I got to the final project, I could see how all those small changes built up into a complete program.

# How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?

Inthe beginning, I was just so focused on making sure my code compiled and ran without crashing. By the later milestones, I was thinking more about how to organize my code and how the pieces connected (like making sure my camera and lighting played nicely with the objects). I definitely grew more confident with OpenGL basics.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science helps me because it pushes me to solve problems and think critically. Even though I might not end up as a graphics programmer, the problem-solving and persistence I learned here will carry over into other areas of my career and education.

# How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

They’ve given me a better understanding of how visuals are built from the ground up, which connects to math and programming in new ways. These skills will help me in future courses where I need to work with simulations, models, or even just data visualization.

# How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Professionally, I could use visualization skills in roles like data analysis or software development where making information clear and interactive is important. Even though I don’t plan on becoming a graphics engineer, understanding how to create and present visuals gives me an edge in explaining complex ideas.
